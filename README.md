# Data Visualization - Completed
This is my project repository for making the 'Data Visualization' project from <em>Python Crash Course 2nd edition</em> by Eric Matthes.

## Summary of Sections
* Creating and graphing random generated data in Python with Matplotlib and Plotly.
* Graphing and styling graphs of real world temperature CSV data.
* Graphing and styling geological JSON data.
* Using API requests to Github and HackerNews to create JSON data
